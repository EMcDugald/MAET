  This project contains methods to solve the forward problem of Magneto Acousto Electric Tomography (MAET).

   MAET is a medical imaging modality, which recovers the conductivity of tissue as a contrast agent. 
A MAET image is obtained by placing the tissue of interest in a conductive medium, and coupling acoustic waves with a constant magnetic field to generate electrical signals.
Let $M(t)$ denote our measurement at time $t$.
